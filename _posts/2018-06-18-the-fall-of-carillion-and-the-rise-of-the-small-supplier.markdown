What can we learn from the fall of such a construction giant, Carillion? With the loss of almost two thousand jobs and countless small businesses struggling to survive, it’s clear that we are on the edge of a pinnacle moment in the construction industry and it’s a time when many lessons can be learnt. 



It’s no surprise that unions are calling for jobs to be safeguarded and small businesses are “wary” of working with the industry giants in the fear of history repeating itself again. It was reported through Parliament.co.ukthat according to Emma Mercer, Carillion’s last Finance Director, that during 2017 payment took and average of 43 days and only about 5% were paid in 120 days. For small suppliers and workers alike this has meant delays in payment to the workers themselves and critical cash flow problems for the supply companies. These delays were enough to even put some companies out of business. 



It seems clear that the industry is choked with by greed and contempt for others further down in the supply chain. The result of this leaves the smaller companies and the tradesment themselves often having to bare the brunt of the consequences. It seems that there is an outcry for increased regulation and moral responsibility across the board to ensure fair play and meet industry standards at every level.



There is a call to spread work and contracts across various different companies to avoid the government, putting all their eggs in one basket, and losing billions of taxpayers money in the meantime. Companies like Jobsolutely are pushing for something called ‘Ethical Supplying’ whereby companies are make a point to look after their workforce by paying them a decent wage and cutting their own profit to increase the satisfaction of the staff. This for each supply company reduces their own staff turnover and recruitment costs and also creates a more trustworthy supply to construction sites and bigger business as workers are looked after not just in the pocket but also in the mind. As we  finish up with  Mental Health Awareness Week surely this is the only way the industry can now go.
