I was recently speaking with a male friend of mine, one whom I have known for many years and have huge admiration for. This is a person I respect and believe to be a ‘new world’ kind of man, fair and definitely not a ‘sexist’. However, in a recent conversation with him the subject of women in construction came up, and whilst I was excited by the fact another industry was finally being woken up to the benefits of a balanced workforce,  his question was, “Aren’t there some things that should just be left alone?”



This statement alone got me thinking, why would he say such a thing? Is that sexist? Does everyone think that about construction? In the year since the #Metoo campaign there has been many shifts in the perception and acceptance of women across various sectors, some have been seismic and others minute. However, if this is what a normal, educated, millennial has to say about the prospect of more women joining the industry, is there really any wonder the numbers of women looking to construction as a valid career option remain low?



From conversations with various others, both males and females, it seems that our perception of the industry itself is what is stopping women turning to it as a viable option. We still believe it is hard graft, outside for long hours and physically women wouldn’t be able to keep up. Whilst it remains true that some roles are all of these things, by continuing to entertain this assumption both men and women neglect to notice the sea of career options which are equally achievable for both genders.  



Luckily some women have made it past the dated, face value assumptions and are forging their careers in this once male dominated industry. Figures show that the last year has seen a huge increase in the number of women taken up positions across all parts of the industry from senior managers all the way to the humble labourer. Women now make up 14% of workers in construction and 37% of new entrants into the sector after higher education.By 2020 these numbers are predicted to be 26% and 45% respectively. 



So times are changing and Women are setting their sites on this career ladder too. I believe with more support and more advocates for women in this workforce a gender balance is not too distant and rightly so. It seems that people like my friends could be forgiven for holding onto such a dated idea of the industry but great to find that others agree with me and are increasingly clocking in to show that in fact, yes there is space for women here.



So to answer the very first question directly back to my male friend and colleague. No! Some things aren’t better just left alone. There is space in this industry for everyone like there is in any other, it’s just about changing the way that we look at it. Agree?
